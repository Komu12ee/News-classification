# ðŸ“° News Classification Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify news articles into different categories such as **Politics** and **Cricket**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (removal of unusual characters, handling missing values, normalization).
- Creation of labeled datasets from raw news content.
- Combination of multiple domain-specific datasets (e.g., politics, cricket).
- Randomized and balanced sampling to ensure fair training data.
- Ready-to-use dataset (`news_combined.csv`) for ML experiments.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Vectorization using TF-IDF/Word2Vec/transformers.
- Training baseline classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).
- Experimenting with deep learning (LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To build a robust text classification system for real-world news categorization tasks.
